# twarc-csv

This module adds CSV Export for Tweets to `twarc`.

First install this plugin:

```
pip install twarc-csv
```

A new `csv` command will be available in twarc. If you have collected some
tweets in a file `tweets.jsonl` you can now convert them to CSV

```
twarc2 search blacklivesmatter tweets.jsonl
twarc2 csv tweets.jsonl tweets.csv
```

## Issues with Twitter Data in CSV

CSV isn't the best choice for storing twitter data. Always keep the
original API responses, and perform feature extraction on json objects.

This export script is intended for convenience, for importing samples of data into other tools. The work in progress script does not expose any customizations or configuration yet, there are many ways to format a CSV of tweets, and this is just one way.
